Speaker Notes:
During the internship, all three milestones progressed simultaneously.

In Week 1, I focused on gathering requirements for PTD/YTD and experimenting with JSON-to-Excel conversion. At the same time, we reviewed VBA workflows for migration and checked library compatibility.

In Week 2, I began developing validation logic and modular functions that would later become part of the Python Assistant.

In Week 3, I set up version control with Bit-Bucket and started working with APIs from the G2 team. JSON processing also improved here.

In Week 4, I started UI-related work for the Assistant app, integrated code modules, and designed the Overview Dashboard Tab to visualize progress.

In Week 5, I finalized validations for multiple sheets and integrated all the logic into the framework.
