Got it âœ… Thanks for sharing the slide headers. Iâ€™ll now create detailed content for each of these sections, aligned with your internship project (JSON to Excel + Macro Migration + Python Assistant Tool).

ðŸ“Š PPT Content Based on Your Headers

Slide 1: Introduction

The project focuses on automation of Excel-related processes which were earlier dependent on VBA macros.

Due to organizational restrictions on macros, existing dashboards and buttons stopped functioning.

To overcome this, we are migrating the logic into Python-based solutions that are scalable, reusable, and efficient.

The project is divided into three key milestones:

1. JSON to Excel Conversion


2. PTD/YTD Framework Migration


3. Python Assistant Application





---

Slide 2: Objective of the Internship

Primary Objective: Replace dependency on macros with Python-based automation.

Specific Goals:

Understand and convert JSON files into formatted Excel sheets.

Re-create PTD (Period-to-Date) & YTD (Year-to-Date) calculation framework in Python.

Develop a Python-based assistant application to support users with validation, contextual help, and SAP flat-file generation.


Future Readiness: Ensure scalability and integration with business processes like SAP uploads.

Slide 3: Work Done So Far (Progress)

Milestone 1 Completed: JSON to Excel Conversion

Successfully parsed JSON input into structured Excel format using pandas & openpyxl.

Implemented formatting: headers, borders, auto column sizing.


Milestone 2 In Progress: PTD/YTD Framework Migration

Analyzing existing VBA macros and logic.

Started implementing modular Python functions for calculations.


Planned Next: Initiate work on Python Assistant Application after framework migration.



---

Slide 4: Learning and Skills Acquired

Technical Skills:

Python scripting for automation.

Data handling with pandas.

Excel operations and styling with openpyxl.

JSON parsing and hierarchical data management.


Conceptual Understanding:

Structure of PTD/YTD calculations in financial reporting.

Migration strategies from legacy systems (VBA) to modern frameworks (Python).


Soft Skills:

Problem-solving under constraints (macro restrictions).

Documentation and clear reporting for stakeholders.




---

Slide 5: Challenges Faced

Macro Restriction Issue: Existing Excel dashboards stopped working â†’ urgent need for migration.

JSON Complexity: Handling nested and irregular JSON data structures.

Column Order Preservation: Needed to follow metadata for correct ordering.

Performance: Large datasets slowed down formatting operations.

Knowledge Transfer: Understanding old VBA logic required detailed analysis.



---

Slide 6: Preliminary Results / Key Insights

JSON to Excel automation is fully functional and replicates the manual/macro-based process.

Python proved to be more flexible and scalable than VBA for handling large datasets.

Structured output Excel is manager-ready with neat formatting.

Early tests of PTD/YTD migration show that Python can handle the logic with improved modularity.

Insight: Transitioning to Python not only replaces macros but also future-proofs the system for enhancements.



---

Slide 7: Next Steps (Remaining Internship Plan)

Complete PTD/YTD Framework Migration: Finalize conversion of all macro logic to Python.

Develop Python Assistant Application:

Build features for data validation, contextual help, and flat-file generation.

Provide a user-friendly interface for business teams.


Future Roadmap:

Add GUI (Tkinter/Streamlit) for easier adoption.

Enable direct integration with SAP upload workflows.

Explore dashboards/visualizations in Python for reporting.

Slide 8: Acknowledgement

I sincerely thank my mentor(s) and team members for their continuous guidance and support during this project.

Special thanks to the organization for providing the opportunity to explore automation, learn new technologies, and contribute to impactful business solutions.

Grateful for the chance to work on a real-world problem that enhances my technical and professional skills.

ðŸ‘‰ This matches your contents slide headers exactly, and itâ€™s framed for an internship project presentation.

Would you like me to also make this shortened into crisp bullet points (for slides) and keep this detailed version as speaker notes?
